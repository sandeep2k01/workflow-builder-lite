# About Me

## Sandeep Damera

Full Stack Developer with experience building production-quality web applications using React, Node.js, and modern JavaScript frameworks. Comfortable working with AI-native tools and integrating LLM capabilities into application architectures.

### What I Bring

- **Full-stack development** — React frontends, Node.js/Express backends, database design
- **AI integration** — Practical experience using LLM APIs (Groq, OpenAI) in structured, production-safe ways
- **Documentation-first approach** — I believe clear documentation is as important as clean code
- **Disciplined engineering** — Modular architecture, proper error handling, separation of concerns
